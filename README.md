# Spring Project 1
This is project repository which will be followed throughout the course.
At the end of this project you will have fully functional simple food delivery application - let us call it <strong>Lagman House</strong>.

## Central asian food Restaurant marketplace
This marketplace sells and delivers various CA dishes. 
I see this project in two parts:
Basic : Only one restaurant which sells various dishes and users buys from this restaurant
Advanced : More restaurants can be added and sell dishes. User can buy dishes from several restaurants at the same time. 

### Basic Part: 
#### Requirements
* A guest user should be able to:
** register into the system with a unique username and password.
** login into the system given some valid credentials.
** see all the dish catalog as well as search per dish category.
* A registered user should be able to:
** add dishes to the shopping cart.
** remove dishes from the shopping cart.
** modify the quantity of a particular dish in the shopping cart.
** check out the shopping cart, which involves:
** sending the user id and cart to an external payment system (see below).
** persisting order details including the Payment ID.
** list existing orders as well as retrieving a specific one by id.
** log out of the system.

* An admin user should be able to:
** add restaurant
** add categories.
** add dishes to the catalog.
** modify the prices of dishes.

* The frontend should be able to:
** Some stuff
** consume data using an HTTP API that we need to define.
